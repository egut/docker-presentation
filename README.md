# Awesome Webapp - A Docker Presentation

This Awesome WebApp is a small example on who to work with docker and docker-compose

## Getting Started

To view and do docker experiments I recommend that you prior to the lab download and install the following:

* The Awesome WebApp [docker-presentation on GitHub](https://github.com/egut/docker-presentation):

```
git clone https://github.com/egut/docker-presentation.git
```

* Install docker follow the instruction on [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)

* Install docker-compose follow the instruction on [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#installing-compose)


* And finally I recommend that you run the following commands to preload your computer with some docker images. It will not start them just download them.

```
docker pull digitallyseamless/nodejs-bower-grunt:0.10-onbuild
docker pull redis
```
